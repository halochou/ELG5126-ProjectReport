The target of this project is to implement a minimal H.264 Baseline/Constrained Baseline Profile decoder in Python programming language. The product is expected to be capable to perform the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item BitStream parsing 
\item Inverse quantization
\item Inverse transformation
\item Motion compensation
\end{itemize}

and, as a result, decode a displayable video sequence from a compressed video file.
