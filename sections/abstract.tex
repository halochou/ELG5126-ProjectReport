Video compression techniques aim to reduce redundancy in video data. 
H.264  has currently became one of the most commonly used formats for the video compression and distribution, 
being one of standards for Blu-ray Discs and also widely used by streaming Internet sources, 
such as videos from Vimeo, YouTube, and the Apple iTunes Store. 
In this project, we will concentrate on the decoding process, doing research on H.264 decoder.
The target of this project is to implement a minimal H.264 Baseline/Constrained Baseline Profile decoder in Python programming language. 
The product is expected to be capable to perform the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item BitStream parsing 
\item Inverse quantization
\item Inverse transformation
\item Motion compensation
\end{itemize}

and, as a result, decode a displayable video sequence from a compressed video file.
