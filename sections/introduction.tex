H.264/AVC is the latest in a series of standards published by the ITU (International Telecommunications Union) and ISO (International Standards Organization). It describes and defines a method of coding video that can give better performance. H.264 makes it possible to compress video into a smaller space, which means that a compressed video clip takes up less transmission bandwidth and/or less storage space compared to older codecs. H.264 compression makes it possible to transmit HD television over a limited-capacity broadcast channel, to record hours of video on a Flash memory card and to deliver massive numbers of video streams over an already busy internet.

The target of this project is to implement a minimal H.264 Baseline/Constrained Baseline Profile decoder. The decoder should be capable to perform tasks below:

\begin{itemize}
\item BitStream Parsing 
\item Inverse Quantzer 
\item Inverse Transform 
\item Motion Compensation 
\end{itemize}

Finally, a displayable video sequence will be produced from a compressed video file
